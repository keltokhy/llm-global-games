The intelligence briefing shows the regime is severely weakened across multiple dimensions - elite cohesion is fracturing, security forces are showing cracks, and public fear has dramatically decreased. With the regime's ability to project power degraded to an \"open question\" and street conversations shifting from whispers to open talk about change, the probability of success appears high enough to justify the risk. The potential gain of +0.2 if successful outweighs the -1.0 loss if it fails, especially given the convergence of evidence suggesting the regime is on the brink of collapse."

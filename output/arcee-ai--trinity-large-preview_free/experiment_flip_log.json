The economic pressures are hitting the regime's core supporters, and the festive atmosphere suggests momentum is building. With the regime distracted by internal struggles and diplomatic signals showing foreign support, joining now offers the best chance for success while the costs of inaction (missing this opportunity) outweigh the risks."

The street mood has shifted from caution to open political discussion, and even business figures are moving money and families out with coordinated urgency. While there are uncertainties about the depth of fractures and the military's stance, the trajectory is unmistakable. Given the high potential payoff of +0.4 if the uprising succeeds and the risk of -1.0 if it fails, joining the uprising is the rational choice when the signs point to a regime in serious trouble."

The intelligence briefing paints a picture of a regime with deep control structures, elite cohesion, and effective information control, making the odds of a successful uprising extremely low. The personal observation of a pharmacist hoarding medical supplies suggests an expectation of worsening conditions, which could make joining a risky and potentially futile act. Given the high cost of failure and the lack of visible momentum, staying home minimizes personal risk while still allowing for the possibility of benefiting from a successful uprising by others."
